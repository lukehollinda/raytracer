Personal pathtracing renderer written entirely in C++. Currently only supports sphere objects. Matte, metallic, and translucent material. Next steps are to implement better anti aliasing and add triangles. 


Can be built using GNU make. Redering parameters can be controlled from the **contants.h** fild and the scene objects can be configured in **driver.cpp**.
